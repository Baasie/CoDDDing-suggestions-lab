# Implementing a Bounded Context in Code

This repository has several labs to guide you from tests to production ready software in Java and C#.

There are 4 labs that build up on each other and you can reach them through the branches. Each Lab has a start and a end solution.
Here are the labs:

* Lab 1 - Implementing a bounded context using Outside-in TDD
* Lab 2 - Supple design - Make the potential of the model clear
* Lab 3 - Deep Model - refactoring to deeper insights (There are two parts to this lab)
* Lab 4 - Coding Lab 4: Ports and Adapters aka Hexagonal architecture - Protecting your bounded context domain model

So please start by checking out the lab1begin branch:
`git checkout Lab1Begin`
